# SSBU Productivity App

## A Java project by Bryan Jhutti

My project will be a **Super Smash Brothers Ultimate Productivity App**. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a
fighting game esport where players can choose 1 of over 80 characters to fight with against 
their opponent. Because of this, many top players struggle to retain information about every 
character, and how to fight them with their own character.

My app will aim to help with players. As a top player myself, I know what it is like to write 
notes against each character, and how tedious it can be. Because of this, I was always looking at 
an alternate method I could use to be more efficient, and I believe this 
application will serve that purpose. I also believe this program would be useful for any competitor who 
is looking to create notes for themselves. 

My program will aim to: 
- allow the user to create specific notes against specific characters
- organize notes in a clear to understand way (multiple sections) with titles 
- separating notes into character played as, and character played against, as well as type of note
- allow for multiple characters
