# SSBU Productivity App

## A Java project by Bryan Jhutti

My project will be a **Super Smash Brothers Ultimate Productivity App**. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a
fighting game esport where players can choose 1 of over 80 characters to fight with against 
their opponent. Because of this, many top players struggle to retain information about every 
character, and how to fight them with their own character.

My app will aim to help with players. As a top player myself, I know what it is like to write 
notes against each character, and how tedious it can be. Because of this, I was always looking at 
an alternate method I could use to be more efficient, and I believe this 
application will serve that purpose. I will aim to allow the user to create 
specific notes against specific characters, and organize it in a very easy to find format, by separating notes 
into sections based on character the user plays, and who they are playing against. This app 
is not just for top players, but any competitor that wishes to create and store character match up notes.
