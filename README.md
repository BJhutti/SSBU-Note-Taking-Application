# SSBU-Note-Taking-Application
A note taking app created. This app allows you to create characters, assign enemies to those characters, and create notes for their matchup. There is functionality to delete, and create each type. 

I created this app to assist me in my competitive esports career! I learned a lot about good programming practices such as refractoring, and different design patterns. I recieved an A+ on this assignment.
